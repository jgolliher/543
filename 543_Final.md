## Assignment

Write a tutorial on the Python programming language intended for competent SAS programmers. That is, *how do you go from knowing SAS to knowing Python?*

Focus on the following areas:
	
* Data Import
* Data Manipulation

Bonus points for going into **Data Analysis as well.**

***

Highlight similarities between SAS and Python as well as differences between the languages. Think about:

* Syntax
* Libraries/Functions
* Variables
* Flow Control (Looping and Branching)

***

Provide references to where the reader can get more in-depth information.

This should be *no more* than 5 pages. Use of pictures, tables, code snippets, examples, etc. are encouraged.

***

Submissions may be made by groups or individuals. Group submissions will result in the same grade assigned to all group members. Every member of the group should independently submit his/her own copy of the group submission. Please identify the members of the group at the very beginning of the source code.

## Importing Data 

Importing data into SAS requires users to follow a few conventions. Notably, creating a *library* as well as specififying the output table, file type, and *guessingrows*. 

Let's use the csv file `SECswim.csv` as an example. In SAS, you would run the following:

**SAS CODE:**

```{SAS}
LIBNAME jg base "~/sasuser.v94"; 

PROC IMPORT FILE = "~/sasuser.v94/SECSwim.csv" out=jg.swim dbms=csv replace;
	guessingrows=max;
```
SAS *requires* users to specify the library with the `LIBNAME` statement, which provide a place to save steps and a place to work with data. Importing data into python, however, involves the following code.

**Python Code**

```{Python}
import pandas as pd

SECSWIM = pd.read_csv("SECSwim.csv")
```
**Note:** The line `import pandas as pd` imports the Python library *Pandas*, which is the de facto data frame and data manipulation library for Python.

A convenient piece of Python is its use of more specified functions for reading in data. For example `pd.read_csv` will read in *comma separated values* documents **without** the need to specify inside the function what kind of data it is importing. Python is more specialized hereâ€“ the `PROC IMPORT FILE` command in SAS requires users to specify the format in which the file stores data because it is a general purpose command. The Python command `pd.read_csv` is built specifically to read *csv* files, which decreases the amount of time spent writing out arguments.

That is not to say, however, that the Python command lacks the ability to specify arguments. Quite the contrary, really.

## Data Analysis

Once data has been imported and manipulated to user specifications in either *SAS* or *Python*, the next step is analysis. Nearly every type of analysis that can be done in *SAS* can be done in *Python* and vice-versa. 

Let's say, that for example, you wish to run *Ordinary Least Squares Regression* on the **SECswim** data to predict a swimmer's `PrelimTime` (the time he/she swam in the preliminary heats) from his/her `SeedTime` (the time he/she was entered into the meet with). 

For the purpose of this illustration we will use `LogSeedTime` and `LogPrelimTime` as the data must be transformed via *the natural log* to better explain the variation.

**SAS Code**

```{SAS}
PROC REG DATA=jg.swim;
	MODEL LogPrelimTime = LogSeedTime;
RUN;
```

One of the convienent things about *SAS* is that it gives you all of this output as soon as you run the *OLS* model. Furthermore, it gives you the *diagnostic plots*, *residuals plot*, and the *fit plot*. This is a difference over *Python*, which will require you to ask for each of these one-by-one. 

**Python Code**

```{Python}
mport pandas as pd 
import statsmodels.formula.api as sm 

SEC = pd.read_csv('SECswim.csv')


result = sm.ols(formula="LogPrelimTime ~ LogSeedTime",data=SEC).fit()
print(result.params)
print(result.summary())
```
This will give the same output as SAS as they follow the same process for obtaining *OLS*. The biggest difference being that *Python* requires users to import secondary libraries in order to accomplish *OLS* while *SAS* can do it natively.
